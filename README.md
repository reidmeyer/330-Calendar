Ran into many problems while doing this but pretty sure it all works.

One small thing. When going around the website, make sure to wait a few seconds in between actions. If you switch between months too quickly, it will print out events twice.


for creative:
    - made it only show the days of the current month
    - make it not display the empty row when not needed
    - the events are sorted by time
    - made it so there was an event tag option with radio buttons to select a class
    - played with drop down bars (selects and datalists)
    - made one account, superuser with password superuser, have their events show up on all calendars.
    - Create a button to delete all events for the specific user incase they want to clear up the calendar.
